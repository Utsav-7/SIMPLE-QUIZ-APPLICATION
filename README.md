The application starts by presenting a set of multiple-choice questions, each with several answer options. Users can select their answer.  Once all questions have been answered, the app calculates the user's score based on the number of correct responses and provides feedback by displaying the total score. The HTML structure defines the layout of the quiz, including sections for questions, answer options, and a button for navigation. The CSS ensures that the design is clean and responsive, making the quiz visually appealing across various devices. JavaScript handles the logic of displaying questions, checking answers, updating the score, and showing the result after completion.
